Thank you to everyone who helped organise, judge, steward and administer this year's record competition of 378 entries from 86 entrants. Thank you also to our sponsors; Craftbrewer, Brewers Choice, Craft Bottleshop, Cryer Malt, Wyeast, the Australian National Homebrew Conference, and a big thanks to Little Creatures for the excellent judging venue.

Entries that placed 1st, 2nd and 3rd in each category, thus qualifying for this year's Australian Amateur Brewing Championship, have been shipped off to Canberra. Score sheets and prize vouchers will hopefully be sent out in the next two weeks.

Good luck to all the entrants who made it to the nationals. Here's hoping we'll have news of a Champion State hat trick in 3 weeks time!
