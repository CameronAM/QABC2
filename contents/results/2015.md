Thank you to everyone who helped organise, judge, steward and administer another record competition of 388 entries from 93 entrants. Thank you also to our sponsors; Craftbrewer, Brewers Choice, Craft Bottleshop, Cryer Malt, Wyeast, National Homebrew, Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies, and a big thanks to the Charming Squire for the excellent judging venue.

Entries that placed 1st, 2nd and 3rd in each category, thus qualifying for this year’s Australian Amateur Brewing Championship, will be sorted for the AABC and entered on the brewers' behalf. Score sheets and prize vouchers will hopefully be sent out in the next two weeks.

Good luck to all the entrants who made it to the nationals.
